# Skills-Tree-UE4-Plugin-Docs

The Skills Tree offers a fast and easy way to incorporate a Skills Tree system in your project. Even though this is a C++ plugin you can leverage every one of its features in Blueprints. In case youâ€™re a C++ programmer, the source code is fully documented so you can extend its functionality to match your needs (source code included in the UE4 marketplace product).
